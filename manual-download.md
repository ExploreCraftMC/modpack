Make sure you copy _everything_, else CurseForge will not load and instead provide you with a 404 page.</br>After the page loads, you'll be greeted by the mod's download page. Scroll down and download the proper version. Don't worry, it's the only option when you scroll down.</br>

After downloading all the mods, drag them into your instance's mods tab:</br>
